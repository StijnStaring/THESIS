List of made assumptions in code - optim_weigths
_____________________________________________________
%% Asssumptions
% The yaw angle of the vehicle remains small --> y-directions speed/acc/jerk is
% an approximation for the real lateral acc/jerk. (vehicle is modelled by a
% moving point)

% straight lane is assumed --> d = (1, 0)

% The jerk can be discontinue. 

% Information of the first dataset is used.

% v_desired is a constant.

% desired lane change distance delta y is a constant.

% desired lane and speed feature --> take the second power to solve it in closed form.

% in feature values --> small dependance of k (= interval number) is
% neglected.

%% Endstate
% when reached the chosen lane with chosen precision
% when the derivative of y is zero, ay and jy are zero

%% Remarks
% The time of every lane chane manoevre is not the same.
% Different manoevres --> different starting speeds
%The dataset provides data with no zero vy(end) --> y(t) the vehicle is
%still increasing y(t) at 10 seconds.
